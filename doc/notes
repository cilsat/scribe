3. Data
Data was taken from audio recordings of the meetings of the Indonesian Regional
Representation Council (Dewan Perwakilan Daerah Republik Indonesia) throughout
2014 and 2015. These recordings were provided by PT Inti, an Indonesian
telecommunication state company, with whom we have jointly developed portions
of the Perisalah speech recognition system *ref. A total of 57 separate meetings
were recorded during this time period, 30 of which were chosen for this
research.

These meetings, which are open to the public, are held by members of the
Regional Representation Council (DPD) to discuss various national concerns
related to the passing of new laws. The official function of the council is to
act as a legaslative control mechanism; when an issue is raised, the council is
responsible for deliberating and studying the issue at hand and producing a
document containing recommendations and insights. The other legislative
branches are obligated to consider this document when passing laws pertaining
to these issues. In addition to their primary function, the council is also
occasionally called upon to resolve conflicts between regional stakeholders
and the government. Hence, the subject matter and structure of the meetings
can generally be classified into one of the following topics:
1. Expert consultation sessions. Experts in relevant fields are called upon to
assess the current status of the issue being discussed and are asked to present
their topic of expertise. These meetings will typically consist of one or more
experts presenting their topics uninterrupted, before concluding with a
question and answering session.
2. Discussing recommendations. These meetings are typically heavily moderated
discussion sessions, whereby the moderator goes through the prepared document
in sections and calls upon the relevant teams for clarification, before opening
discussion to the floor for that section. Although still relatively structured
due to the moderation, these meetings can at times produce portions of
overlapping speech.
3. Conflict resolution. This involves a hearing between two sides in a conflict
usually regarding settlements related to land rights. The two sides are called
upon to make statements regarding the issue before the council, after which
the council will discuss the issue.
4. Miscellaneous. These are usually meetings to discuss internal matters, for
instance with regards to scheduling future meetings, deadlines, diplomatic
visits to various regions, et cetera.

The varied conditions of these meetings with regards to speaker participation
are presented in *table.

The raw audio recordings were first analyzed to determine the total duration of
speech they contained, as meetings were often preceded, succeeded, and
occasionally punctured by long stretches of silence.

Due to the lack of metadata and large number of speakers, an iterative approach
was taken whereby
